# neural-style-tf

This is a TensorFlow implementation of Histogram loss technique described in the paper:
* [Stable and Controllable Neural Texture Synthesis and Style Transfer Using Histogram Losses](https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.08893)
by Eric Risser, Pierre Wilmot, Connelly Barnes

WORK IN PROGRESS

This implementation is in turn based on the [neural-style-tf](https://github.com/cysmith/neural-style-tf) project which implements several techniques described in the papers: 
* [Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks](http://www.cv-foundation.org/openaccess/content_cvpr_2016/papers/Gatys_Image_Style_Transfer_CVPR_2016_paper.pdf)
